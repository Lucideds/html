        <h2><font size="130"><font color="white">Crash</font></font></h2>
        <p><font color="white">Crash is a game where you gamble an amount and there is a multiplier that increasingly goes up and rapidly increases in speed the higher up it goes.But, there is a high chance that the multiplier can cras and it will stop multiplying.If you don't cash out before it crashes then you lose all the money you gambled.But if you do cashout then you multiply your gamblings by the multiplier.So, the trick to this game is that you want to cash out quite eraly if you are gambling high amounts and if you ware gambling low amounts like 1-50 robux then you might want to shoot high and go for a multiplier such as 4x or higher.But, it can crash at 1.00x sometimes but not that often.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="130"><font color="white">Cases</font></font></h3>
        <p><font color="white">Cases is a game where you open different cases that have good items in and bad items in and you can either play against a bot or against real players.The cases themselves cost varies amounts of robux, the more expensive ones having better items and vice versa. There isn't really a trick to this game other than you don't really want to play cases if you are lookingto make money as they are so risky and are just luck.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="130"><font color="white">Mines</font></font></h3>
        <p><font color="white">Mines is probably (in my opinion) the best way to make money in Bloxflip because if you play it right it is very easy to not loose your robux.Mines is a game where you can choose an amount of mines from 1,3,5,10,15,20.The more mines there are, the more money you can win.But don't be fooled by this.The best way to make money on mines is to either play on 1 mine or 3 mines and click on 3-5 tiles ad then cashout. </font></p>
        <h4><font size="130"><font color="white">Towers</font></font></h4>
        <p><font color="white">In my opinion towers is one of the worst ways to make robux because it is complete luk and takes no skill.It works by there being 3 lanes that you can pick from and 2 of them being either safe or unsafe(depending on the difficulty you picked).As you go up the tower the reward you get will increase but to get fully to the top it is a 1/6561 chance. If you were to try and make money on this game(but i wouldn't recommend it) would be to gamble a low amount like 1-5 robux and try to get lucky and reach as high as you can or gamble a decent amount and try and get one path and then cashout.</font></p>
        <h5><font size="130"><font color="white">Cups,Jackpot and Roulette</font></font></h5>
        <p><font color="white">Cups(much like towers and cases)is complete luck and doesn't have any trick really.I've never really played cups so i can't give any tricks on it apart from DO NOT PLAY IT.The same with roullete and jackpot, the only advice i can give you is to not play it.</font></p>
